# AdvancedOregen 1.0.1 developed by khanghoang
# Note: All the spawnrates should be less than 1.0 and the sum of them should be equals 1.0.
# The permission of each generator is starts with 'oregen.' and follow by its name (e.g 'oregen.vip').
# It must have one default generator. The default generator does not need any permission.

# Run plugin in debug mode
debug: false

# Here you can define your ore generator machine.
# The placeholders available are %oregen_label%, %oregen_name%, %oregen_permission%. 
# You need to install PlaceholderAPI to get it to work.
# The islandLevel attribute is the minimum insland level required to make the generator works.
